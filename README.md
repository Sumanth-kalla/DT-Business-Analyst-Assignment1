# DT-Business-Analyst-Assignment1
About This Submission

This repository contains my submission for the DT CultureTech Business Analyst (Clinic Operations & Care Systems) Role Test Drive Assignment.

The assignment focuses on designing practical, low-friction systems that clinics can realistically run to reduce operational errors and protect doctor time.
No software has been built as this submission is intentionally focused on system design, daily workflows, and decision rules, in line with the assignment instructions.

Contents

Task1_Daily_Clinic_Inventory_Micro_Audit.pdf
A step-by-step daily micro-audit system designed to detect inventory and billing errors early in a small clinic pharmacy, without disrupting doctor workflow.

Task2_Patient_Care_Communication_Control_System.pdf
A Google Sheet–based patient communication and follow-up system designed to minimize WhatsApp chaos while preserving care quality and limiting doctor involvement to short review windows.

How to Read

Each document is written to be operational and runnable:

Clear daily and weekly checklists

Sample tables and decision rules

Explicit limits on doctor involvement

Designed for real clinic constraints (time, staff, tools)

The documents are intended to be read as clinic-ready operating guides, not theoretical proposals.

Closing Note

This submission reflects my understanding of clinic realities, doctor time constraints, and the importance of systems that absorb human error instead of relying on individual vigilance.

Thank you for the opportunity to work through this role test drive.
